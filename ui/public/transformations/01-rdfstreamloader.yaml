    label: RDF serialization
    help: Specify the syntax for the RDF serialization. Default is Turtle.
    values:
      - Turtle
      - RDF/XML

  - name: globalPrefixes
    help: Specifically designed for Turtle syntax. Fintan will load one segment at a time. In a Turtle file, usually the prefixes are defined globally in the beginning of the File. They can however be repeated and overriden for each segment. *true* Fintan propagates the global prefixes to each segment automatically. *false* Fintan expects individual prefixes for each segment.
    label: Prefixes are set globally
