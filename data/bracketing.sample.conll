# First sentence of WSJ 0655, with POS and syntax annotation from PennTreebank (cols 2-3) and OntoNotes (cols 4-5)
# The sentence and its OntoNotes annotation was previously published in https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/docs/LDC2011T03/OntoNotes-Release-4.0.pdf
# The PTB annotation is quoted here for illustrative purposes. Both annotations are similar, but not identical.
# Both OntoNotes and PTB CoNLL representations have been created from the PTB bracketing format and 
# automatically merged using CoNLL-Merge (https://github.com/acoli-repo/conll, force [-f] mode).

# Note that for reasons of copyright, we cannot quote more than one sentence here.
